## Overview

This project is a simple, interactive rating card component that allows users to give a rating on a scale of 1 to 5. Originally this is my solution to the Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor using simple JavaScript to update the DOM. However I took the opportunity to build out my solution using React and styled-components. It also served as an opportunity to practice using the useState hook.
